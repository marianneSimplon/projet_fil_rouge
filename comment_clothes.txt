I bought this, and the cut was super strange, and the stitches were already coming apart on arrival. But I didn't return it, because I would have had to pay for shipping to China.
This is so not like the picture. It is very thin and nylon scratchy material that feels cheap and uncomfortable. At best it can be worn under something to show the hood but won't keep you very warm either. It is also slightly weirdly shaped too. Not flattering or comfortable!


Very thin and not good quality
Very disappointed with the top the material is so thin more like a t shirt. I’ve had cheaper hoodies that were a better quality and warm for half the price.
I love this hoodie, it's light weight, lovely colour, just right for the spring weather worn it loads, no colour, run washes well. Fits to size, good length. 55
I love the fit, excellent with jeans. Good summer weight top.
My go to top now. Really nice top. Good fit and perfect for when it’s just a little cooler
WRONG - I really liked this hoodie and I loved the colours. I don't particularly like baggy clothing and I usually buy a size 14 top. But after reading the size chart I went with the size 6/8 and it fits me really well, if not a bit short on the arms. My only annoyance was with the stitching on the inside, it's like 4 hoodies sewn together where the separate colours are, basically the stitching sticks out and rubs your skin.
WRONG - Nothing not to dislike, fits lovely washes great, tumble drys,
WRONG - Good quality product fits really well and looks great.

I love this dress! It fits well!
I hate this shirt, it's too cheap.
